Hi! I’m **Neha Mittal**, a Machine Learning Engineer with hands-on experience designing and optimizing large-scale intent-classification systems.  
Most recently, I worked at **Microsoft**, where I helped improve **Copilot’s** natural-language intent detection pipeline—covering everything from data curation and model benchmarking to **ONNX/TensorRT quantization**, **latency profiling (p50/p75/p90)**, and **real-time inference debugging** across Polymer workflows.

My core interests lie in **LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and **efficient inference systems**—specifically, how to make large models faster, leaner, and more contextually aware. I’ve also worked on internal evaluation frameworks, prompt-driven data synthesis, and semantic clustering for text understanding tasks.


When I’m not working on models, I love music production, creative AI visuals, and curating faceless content projects that blend tech with design.
